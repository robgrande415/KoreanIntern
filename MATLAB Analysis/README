This document provides an overview over the folders and functions in the MATLAB section of this project.

Folders:
data - contains all data, both raw and processed
figures - contains all figures generated by the scripts
SimpleEx - Folder used in the early stages of this project to test our solution vs. Gonzalez et. al. Not used in the paper.

Functions:
appendMat - used to create the matrix required for Gonzalez et. al's CoM prediction method
drawSkeleton - creates a cartoon of the human skeleton with locations of the CoM and coloring proportional to mass amounts
getInterpValue - used to interpolate values from the Wii to time stamps of the Kinect. The Kinect and Wii do not have the same sampling rate, which is why this is required.
saveTightFigure - auxiliary function for saving matlab fig's to pdf's without white space


Scripts:
getJointID - assigns variable names to indices corresponding to joint measurements
getJointID - same as above, only for the VolumeAnalysis script
getPrior_Educated - this script creates the parameter mean and variances for the prior distribution used in the algorithms
main_GaussianPrior - This script learns the MAP parameters using a Gaussian Prior distribution approximation.
main_MCMC - learns the MAP parameters using MCMC-MH using a sampling process
main_PF - learns the MAP parmaeters by approximating the posterior distribution with a particle filter
preprocess - loads and filters the data for use in inference
volumeAnalysis - this inputs pictures from the Kinect and figures out the relative volumes of each body part. Using a uniform density approximation, one might find the mass properties.
