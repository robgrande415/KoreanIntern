abstract={In this paper, a new generation of hypersonic vehicles offers a far more effective way of launching small satellites or other vehicles into low-Earth orbit than expendable rockets. Additionally these aircraft facilitate quick response and global strike capabilities. Control of hypersonic vehicles is challenging due to the changes in the aircraft dynamics as the manuever takes the aircraft over large flight envelopes.The field of adaptive control began with the motivation that a controller that can adjust its parameters online could generate improved performance over a fixed-parameter counterpart. Subsequently, sobering lessons of tradeoffs between stability and performance directed the evolution of the field toward the design, analysis, and synthesis of stable adaptive systems. Various adaptive control methods have been developed for controlling linear and nonlinear dynamic systems with parametric and dynamic uncertainties.With the benefit of hindsight and subsequent research, the paper revisit the events of 1967 by examining "how and what if" scenarios.we analyze the X-15-3 aircraft dynamics and the Honeywell MH-96 adaptive controller in an effort to better understand how the sequence of events and the interplay between the controller and the aircraft dynamics might have led to the instability and resulting crash. It follows with a depiction of a Lyapunov-stability-based adaptive controller that incorporates gain scheduling and accommodates actuator magnitude saturation, which we denote as the gain-scheduled, magnitude-saturation-accommodating.},

  abstract =     {The force tracking error is dependent on both the position tracking error and the estimated parameter error so that, in constrained adaptive robot control, the convergence of the estimated parameter error becomes more important than in unconstrained adaptive robot control. However, in the direct adaptive controller, the parameter adaptation is driven only by the tracking error in the joint motion, while in the indirect adaptive controller, the parameter estimation is driven only by the prediction error in the joint torque. Based on this observation a new combined direct and indirect adaptive controller driven by both the tracking error and the prediction error is developed for constrained robots with inertia parameter uncertainty. Stability of the combined adaptive controllers is established in the Lyapunov sense. The combined control improves both position and force tracking performance compared with direct adaptive control. The computer simulations are presented to demonstrate the proposed schemes.

  abstract =     {Neural networks have been extensively used for adaptive system identification as well as adaptive and neuroadaptive control of highly uncertain systems. The goal of adaptive and neuroadaptive control is to achieve system performance without excessive reliance on system models. To improve robustness and the speed of adaptation of adaptive and neuroadaptive controllers several controller architectures have been proposed in the literature. In this dissertation, we developed a new neuroadaptive control architecture for nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems as well as nonlinear nonnegative uncertain dynamical systems.
                Nonnegative systems are essential in capturing the behavior of a wide range of dynamical systems involving dynamic states whose values are nonnegative. A subclass of nonnegative dynamical systems are compartmental systems. These systems are derived from mass and energy balance considerations and are comprised of homogeneous interconnected microscopic subsystems or compartments which exchange variable quantities of material via intercompartmental flow laws. In this research, we developed a direct adaptive and neuroadaptive control framework for stabilization, disturbance rejection and noise suppression for nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems with exogenous system disturbances.
                Furthermore, we developed a new neuroadaptive control architecture for nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems. Specifically, the proposed framework involves a new and novel controller architecture involving additional terms, or Q-modification terms, in the update laws that are constructed using a moving time window of the integrated system uncertainty. The Q-modification terms can be used to identify the ideal neural network system weights which can be used in the adaptive law. In addition, these terms effectively suppress system uncertainty.
                Finally, neuroadaptive output feedback control architecture for nonlinear nonnegative dynamical systems with input amplitude and integral constraints is developed. This architecture is used to control lung volume and minute ventilation with input pressure constraints that also accounts for spontaneous breathing by the patient. Specifically, we develop a pressure- and work-limited neuroadaptive controller for mechanical ventilation based on a nonlinear multi-compartmental lung model. The control framework does not rely on any averaged data and is designed to automatically adjust the input pressure to the patient's physiological characteristics capturing lung resistance and compliance modeling uncertainty. Moreover, the controller accounts for input pressure constraints as well as work of breathing constraints. The effect of spontaneous breathing is incorporated within the lung model and the control framework.

abstract={An analog system for fixed point computation is described. The system is derived from a continuous time analog of the classical over-relaxed fixed point iteration. The dynamical system is proved to converge for nonexpansive mappings under all p norms, p isin;(1, infin;). This extends previously established results to not necessarily differentiable maps which are nonexpansive under the infin;-norm. The system will always converge to a single fixed point in a connected set of fixed points. This allows the system to function as a complementary paradigm to energy minimization techniques for optimization in the analog domain. It is shown that the proposed technique is applicable to a large class of dynamic programming computations},

abstract={This paper provides a theoretical framework for analysis of consensus algorithms for multi-agent networked systems with an emphasis on the role of directed information flow, robustness to changes in network topology due to link/node failures, time-delays, and performance guarantees. An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the role of small-world effects on the speed of consensus algorithms and cooperative control of multivehicle formations},

 abstract ={In coming to understand the world—in learning concepts, acquiring language, and grasping causal relations—our minds make inferences that appear to go far beyond the data available. How do we do it? This review describes recent approaches to reverse-engineering human learning and cognitive development and, in parallel, engineering more humanlike machine learning systems. Computational models that perform probabilistic inference over hierarchies of flexibly structured representations can address some of the deepest questions about the nature and origins of human thought: How does abstract knowledge guide learning and reasoning from sparse data? What forms does our knowledge take, across different domains and tasks? And how is that abstract knowledge itself acquired?},
