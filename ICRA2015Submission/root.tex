\begin{abstract}
Estimation of human body inertia parameters and center of mass is important for a variety of applications such as understanding the motion and stability of humans, personalizing rehabilitation programs, and humanoid robot teleoperation via motion imitation.
%utilization as an index for fall prediction.
While previous methods can estimate the inertial parameters or center of mass, these methods either require an expensive or specialized setup or can only estimate the center of mass, not the inertial parameters.
%Controlling a humanoid robot is extremely difficult due to a high dimensional state-space and unstable dynamics, however, athletes and performers perform remarkable feats of balance and control with apparent ease. 
%Thus, one attractive approach to control a humanoid robot is teleoperation using motion imitation of a human.
%Due to differences in inertial parameterss and limb lengths, one cannot na\"ively transfer joint angles from a human operator to the robot without introducing instability, however. 
In this paper, we introduce a novel method for estimating inertial parameters and center of mass of a human operator using an inexpensive Wii Balance Board and Kinect camera system. 
%It is shown that previous approaches that estimate the parameters via least squares and static poses cannot be used to estimate inertial parameters, and in order to overcome these deficiencies, 
It is shown that approaches using na\"ive methods such as least squares cannot be used to estimate the inertial parameters, and in order to overcome these deficiencies, we utilize approximate Bayesian inference algorithms to estimate the inertial parameters. 
The experiments show that the methods proposed in this paper not only outperform existing algorithms in terms of predicting center of mass but also successfully return realistic estimates of the inertial parameters.
%Lastly, we propose a simple algorithm for transferring the motion of a human to that of a robot and test it in simulation. Our preliminary results show that the algorithm successfully is able to transfer the positions of the human operator to the robot without causing instability.
